# path to 1.0

everything is done and ready, just waiting for the right moment now i guess

## current state

all the pieces are in place, the code works, tests pass, security scans are clean, the infrastructure is solid, workflows are automated, documentation exists, it's just a matter of timing now

## what's left

final bug squashing, there's always something, then introducing the upload command on the testing branch, test it there, make sure it works, then merge to stable, test the stable version, make sure everything still works together, then release the stable version, test that release, make sure it's actually stable, then 1.0

## the plan

fix remaining bugs, add upload command to testing branch, test upload command thoroughly, merge to stable, test stable branch, release stable version, test the release, then 1.0 release

simple enough, just need to execute it

## why wait

no real reason, everything works, the code is solid, the tests pass, security is good, but 1.0 feels like it should be special and "ready" (as arbitrary as can be), so we wait, we test, we make sure, then we release

## when

when it's ready, when the bugs are squashed, when the upload command is implemented, when stable is actually stable, when the release works, then, and only then, 1.0

no rush, it'll happen when it happens

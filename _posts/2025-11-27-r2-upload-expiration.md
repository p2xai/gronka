# file retention policy update

starting now, files uploaded through gronka will be automatically deleted after 72 hours (3 days).

## what this means

any file you upload, convert, or download through gronka will be available for 72 hours, then automatically removed from storage. this applies to gifs, videos, and images.

if you want to keep a file longer, make sure to download or save it within 72 hours of uploading it.

## why

storage costs add up over time, and most files are accessed right after they're created. the 72-hour window gives plenty of time to grab files you want while keeping things manageable.

## existing files

files uploaded before this policy went into effect remain available - this only applies to new uploads from now on.

## what you should do

if you use gronka and want to keep files longer than 72 hours, download them to your device within 3 days of uploading. the bot will still provide links for 72 hours, but after that the files will be gone.

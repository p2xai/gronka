# what is gronka?

when i made gronka, it was originally a docker container running ffmpeg and a [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools) instance that i interacted with through a [nighty.one](https://nighty.one) script i made, i originally made that back in june of this year to satisfy my vibe coding urges, that motivation now lives vicariously throught gronka, instead of 'localcobalt-nighty', a docker compose, 2 python scripts i have an actual website and stuff for this project so its alot more maintained; still just me maintaing it though

# why is gronka?

gronka purely exists because i like to download stuff on the internet, bit of an archivist if you must. (i seed movies, 10> mb seeded on [anna's archive](https://annas-archive.org)) thanks to the awesome people at [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools), both localcobalt-nighty and gronka are able to do their jobs very well and very (somewhat) fast

# who is gronka?

i genuinely thought of the name actively spitballing because the bots name before verification was esm (rip of [esmBot](https://esmbot.net/)) and typing random letters in and made gronk, threw an a on the end and never thought about it again, its quite fitting too

# where is gronka?

gronka's primary instance is ran on my home server for processing where as semi-persistent media lives on cloudflare r2 somewhere in atlanta

# when is gronka?

i started gronka november 15th 2025 because discord file limits for poor people was too much, it was primarily just to embed locally downloaded media from cobalt in discord by using cloudflared tunnels (now deprecated in favor of cloudflare r2)

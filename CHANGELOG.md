  - Clarified that PostgreSQL is now required
  - Updated configuration examples to show PostgreSQL-only setup

### Added

- Enhanced clean-slate reset script to wipe PostgreSQL databases
  - Updated `scripts/reset-clean-slate.js` to drop all PostgreSQL tables when PostgreSQL is configured
  - Script now handles both database types: drops PostgreSQL tables and deletes SQLite database files
  - Added `wipePostgresDatabase()` function that connects to PostgreSQL and drops all tables in correct order

### Changed

  - Bot process now includes minimal HTTP server for stats endpoint only
  - WebUI now calculates stats directly from database and filesystem instead of proxying HTTP requests

### Fixed

- Fixed PostgreSQL test failures after SQLite to PostgreSQL migration
  - Fixed timestamp comparison issues by switching from strict equality to approximate matching (1 second tolerance)
  - Fixed duplicate key violations in logs by ensuring unique timestamps and component names for each test
  - Fixed user count mismatches by using unique user IDs per test run to prevent conflicts with previous test data
  - Fixed connection handling in `insertProcessedUrl` to gracefully handle closed database connections
  - Added cache invalidation in test setup to prevent stale data from previous test runs
  - Updated test files: `test/utils/database.test.js`, `test/utils/user-tracking.test.js`, `test/utils/log-metrics.test.js`
  - Updated database function: `src/utils/database/processed-urls-pg.js` for better error handling
- Fixed WebUI "invalid date" errors for timestamps after PostgreSQL migration
  - PostgreSQL's `postgres.js` library returns BIGINT values as strings instead of numbers
  - WebUI was showing "invalid date" because `new Date(timestamp)` failed when timestamp was a string
  - Created helper functions in `src/utils/database/helpers-pg.js` to convert timestamp fields from strings to numbers
  - Updated all PostgreSQL query functions to convert timestamps before returning:
    - `logs-pg.js` - Converts `timestamp` in `getLogs()` and `getLogMetrics()`
    - `alerts-pg.js` - Converts `timestamp` in `getAlerts()` and `insertAlert()`
    - `operations-pg.js` - Converts `timestamp` in `getOperationLogs()`, `getOperationTrace()`, and `getRecentOperations()` (including nested timestamps in performance metrics steps)
    - `metrics-pg.js` - Converts `timestamp` in `getSystemMetrics()`, `getLatestSystemMetrics()`, and `last_command_at`/`updated_at` in `getUserMetrics()` and `getAllUsersMetrics()`
    - `users-pg.js` - Converts `first_used` and `last_used` in `getUser()`
    - `processed-urls-pg.js` - Converts `processed_at` in `getProcessedUrl()`, `getUserMedia()`, and `getUserR2Media()`
  - All timestamps are now returned as numbers, allowing `new Date()` to parse them correctly
  - WebUI now displays timestamps correctly instead of showing "invalid date"
- Fixed WebUI API empty responses after Postgres migration
  - Fixed critical async/await bug in `src/webui-server/index.js` where `getRecentOperations()` was called without `await` during server startup
  - Operations were not loading from Postgres database at startup, causing empty responses
  - Added proper validation to ensure operations array is valid before processing
  - Enhanced error handling in route handlers (`users.js`, `logs.js`, `metrics.js`) with null/undefined checks
  - Added comprehensive error logging with stack traces for debugging database query failures
  - All endpoints now properly handle async database queries and return correct data types (arrays/numbers instead of empty objects)
  - WebUI API endpoints now return proper JSON responses with data instead of empty `{}` objects

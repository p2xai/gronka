If the log is displayed as a plain text file, then new line characters can be used by a malicious user. If the log is displayed as HTML, then arbitrary HTML may be included to spoof log entries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUser input should be suitably sanitized before it is logged.\n\nIf the log entries are in plain text then line breaks should be removed from user input, using `String.prototype.replace` or similar. Care should also be taken that user input is clearly marked in log entries.\n\nFor log entries that will be displayed in HTML, user input should be HTML-encoded before being logged, to prevent forgery and other forms of HTML injection.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first example, a username, provided by the user, is logged using \\`console.info\\`. In the first case, it is logged without any sanitization. In the second case, the username is used to build an error that is logged using \\`console.error\\`.

      "full_description": "Allowing writes to arbitrary properties of an object may lead to denial-of-service attacks.",
      "help": "# Remote property injection\nDynamically computing object property names from untrusted input may have multiple undesired consequences. For example, if the property access is used as part of a write, an attacker may overwrite vital properties of objects, such as `__proto__`. This attack is known as *prototype pollution attack* and may serve as a vehicle for denial-of-service attacks. A similar attack vector, is to replace the `toString` property of an object with a primitive. Whenever `toString` is then called on that object, either explicitly or implicitly as part of a type coercion, an exception will be raised.\n\nMoreover, if the name of an HTTP header is user-controlled, an attacker may exploit this to overwrite security-critical headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` or `Content-Security-Policy`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe most common case in which prototype pollution vulnerabilities arise is when JavaScript objects are used for implementing map data structures. This case should be avoided whenever possible by using the ECMAScript 2015 `Map` instead. When this is not possible, an alternative fix is to prepend untrusted input with a marker character such as `$`, before using it in properties accesses. In this way, the attacker does not have access to built-in properties which do not start with the chosen character.\n\nWhen using user input as part of a header name, a sanitization step should be performed on the input to ensure that the name does not clash with existing header names such as `Content-Security-Policy`.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the dynamically computed property `prop` is accessed on `myObj` using a user-controlled value.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\nvar myObj = {}\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tvar prop = req.query.userControlled; // BAD\n\tmyObj[prop] = function() {};\n\tconsole.log(\"Request object \" + myObj);\n});\n```\nThis is not secure since an attacker may exploit this code to overwrite the property `__proto__` with an empty function. If this happens, the concatenation in the `console.log` argument will fail with a confusing message such as \"Function.prototype.toString is not generic\". If the application does not properly handle this error, this scenario may result in a serious denial-of-service attack. The fix is to prepend the user-controlled string with a marker character such as `$` which will prevent arbitrary property names from being overwritten.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\nvar myObj = {}\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tvar prop = \"$\" + req.query.userControlled; // GOOD\n\tmyObj[prop] = function() {};\n\tconsole.log(\"Request object \" + myObj);\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* Prototype pollution attacks: [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/9287), [lodash](https://hackerone.com/reports/310443), [hoek](https://npmjs.com/advisories/566).\n* Penetration testing report: [ header name injection attack](http://seclists.org/pen-test/2009/Mar/67)\n* npm blog post: [ dangers of square bracket notation](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security/blob/3c7522ca1be800353513282867a1034c795d9eb4/docs/the-dangers-of-square-bracket-notation.md)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-250](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

      "help": "# Log injection\nIf unsanitized user input is written to a log entry, a malicious user may be able to forge new log entries.\n\nForgery can occur if a user provides some input with characters that are interpreted when the log output is displayed. If the log is displayed as a plain text file, then new line characters can be used by a malicious user. If the log is displayed as HTML, then arbitrary HTML may be included to spoof log entries.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUser input should be suitably sanitized before it is logged.\n\nIf the log entries are in plain text then line breaks should be removed from user input, using `String.prototype.replace` or similar. Care should also be taken that user input is clearly marked in log entries.\n\nFor log entries that will be displayed in HTML, user input should be HTML-encoded before being logged, to prevent forgery and other forms of HTML injection.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first example, a username, provided by the user, is logged using \\`console.info\\`. In the first case, it is logged without any sanitization. In the second case, the username is used to build an error that is logged using \\`console.error\\`. If a malicious user provides \\`username=Guest%0a\\[INFO\\]+User:+Admin%0a\\` as a username parameter, the log entry will be splitted in two different lines, where the second line will be \\`\\[INFO\\]+User:+Admin\\`.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst url = require('url');\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n    let q = url.parse(req.url, true);\n\n    console.info(`[INFO] User: ${q.query.username}`); // BAD: User input logged as-is\n})\n\nserver.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {});\n\n```\nIn the second example, `String.prototype.replace` is used to ensure no line endings are present in the user input.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst url = require('url');\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n    let q = url.parse(req.url, true);\n\n    // GOOD: remove newlines from user controlled input before logging\n    let username = q.query.username.replace(/\\n|\\r/g, \"\");\n\n    console.info(`[INFO] User: ${username}`);\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Log Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Log_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html).\n",

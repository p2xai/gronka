# gronka

a discord bot that turns your videos and images into gifs. that's it. that's the bot.

## what it does

gronka takes video files or images you send in discord and converts them to gifs. no fancy features, no bloat - just straightforward file conversion. 

it supports most common video formats (mp4, mov, webm, avi, mkv) and image formats (png, jpg, jpeg, webp)
## how it works

there are three parts to this thing:

1. **discord bot** - the part that lives in your server and does the converting
2. **cdn server** - serves up the gifs after they're made
3. **webui** (optional) - a simple dashboard if you want to see stats

## getting started

### running it locally

you'll need node.js 20+ and ffmpeg installed. then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p2xai/gronka.git
cd gronka
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

edit `.env` and add your discord token and client id. then:

```bash
npm run register-commands
npm run local
```

### using docker


```bash
# create your .env file first
docker compose up -d

# register discord commands (only need to do this once)
docker compose run --rm app npm run register-commands
```

## configuration

you need these two things in your `.env`:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - get this from the discord developer portal
- `CLIENT_ID` - same place

everything else is optional. check `.env.example` for what you can tweak (output quality, file size limits, that kind of stuff).

### optimization settings

when using `/optimize`, you can specify a lossy compression level:
- range: 0-100 (default: 35)
- lower values (0-30): less compression, higher quality, larger files
- medium values (30-60): balanced compression and quality
- higher values (60-100): more compression, lower quality, smaller files

for context menu optimization, a modal will appear to let you enter the lossy level.

## using gronka

### commands

- `/convert` - attach a file or paste a url to convert it
- `/optimize` - optimize an existing gif to reduce file size (supports custom lossy level 0-100)
- `/stats` - see how many gifs gronka has made
- right-click a message → apps → "convert to gif" - quick convert from any message
- right-click a message → apps → "optimize" - optimize a gif from any message

### the cdn

gronka hosts the gifs it makes. you can hit these endpoints:

- `GET /health` - is it alive?
- `GET /stats` - storage info
- `GET /gifs/{hash}.gif` - your actual gif
- `GET /` - api info

### dashboard

if you want to see pretty stats:

```bash
docker compose --profile webui up -d webui
```

then go to `http://localhost:3001`



## development

useful commands:

```bash
npm start              # start the bot
npm run server         # start the cdn
npm run local          # run both at once
npm run dev            # bot with hot reload
npm run lint           # check code style
npm run format         # auto-format code
```

the project uses eslint and prettier. run `npm run validate` before committing if you care about that stuff.

## inspiration

this is basically a spiritual successor to esmbot. i needed something simple that just converts files to gifs without all the extra stuff.
